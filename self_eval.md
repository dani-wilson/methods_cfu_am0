# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
I'm proud of finishing all the practices and challenges even though they were frustrating and I felt like giving up. I'm proud of myself for learning so many new things in a short amount of time.

- What is the power of using methods in our applications?
Methods make things easier by defining a package of instructions that can be used over and over again in code. They can be reused as many times as needed.
